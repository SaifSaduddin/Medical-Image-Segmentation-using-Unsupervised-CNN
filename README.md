# Medical-Image-Segmentation-using-Unsupervised-CNN
For my Master's thesis project, I am working with two medical image dataset (Brain image data i.e. CT and DynaCT) to firstly, segment them and then find the similarity between them using an unsupervised Convolution Neural Network (CNN) technique. 











parse-segmentation.py contains the python code for segmenting the original CT and DynaCT images
Image_similarity_features_extraction.ipynb contains the python code for the similarity measurements between two segmented CT and DynaCT images.
